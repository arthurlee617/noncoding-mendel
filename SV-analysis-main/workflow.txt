Exploded.tsv - filtered for location + phenotype

lauren/hail/hail-files/SV/SV-filter.R -> takes complete SV inh call bed, filters it into phenotype-specific SV’s (location, family, splits into line per SV per individual, per peak): -SV-inher-exploded.tsv

SV-analysis.py uses hail to aggregate all calls back into single line per SV
Filter any SV’s that are present in an unaffected individual
Import full callset as MT
Use this to filter out improperly inherited SV’s in large pedigrees
Collect list of families w large pedigrees and list of fitting sv’s; filter aggregated table to remove any SV’s present in these families that do not fit structure

Generate list of phenotype-specific SV loci that contain >=1 accessible peak
